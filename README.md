### WHAT IS SOCIALCONNECT?

Social Connect is a platform where users can connect multiple social medias easily and efficently. We provide a service that essentially saves people a lot of time and allows you to have all your social medias in one link!

### HOW DO YOU USE SOCIALCONNECT?

The beauty of this app, is that it's so easy to use! No logins required!!

Simply editing the following screen with you social media information is all you need to do!

#### Accounts Page

<img src="accountspage.png" alt="test" width = "100%">

After you're done, hit save and you'll get sent back to the main screen with an updated QR code.

#### Main Page

<img src="mainpage.png" alt="test" width = "100%">

That's it! Get someone to scan your code with any QR scanner! (default iPhone camera, even snapchat works)

#### Web Page

<img src="webpage.png" alt="test" width = "100%">

Once they hit the landing page, they'll have all your social medias. No need to remember any names!

### THE END

Overall this was a fun project to make! Hope you all enjoy it!
